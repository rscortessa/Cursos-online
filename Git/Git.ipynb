    "\n",
    "* If you made a commit and after this you see that something goes wrong, it is time to \"Rollback\", Rollback is a kind of commit that makes the opposite: invert the changes made in a commit. You need to write the command: ***git revert HEAD*** and this will open a window to write the message concerning about this rollback.\n",

    "### 5.4 Identifying a commit <a id='identifying'></a>\n",
    "* We have made rollbacks to the last commit that was sent, forthis purpose it was used the \"HEAD\" alias to specify that the commit to revert was the last but what happened if the error didn't happen in the last commit? for revert any other commit we need to use the ***commit id*** instead of the alias ***HEAD***.\n",

    "* The default branch that git creates for you when a repository is initialized is called ***master***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Having different branches allows you experiment with new ideas or correct some mistakes in the project without affect all the work saved in the branch HEAD. <br> Think about this as different notebooks where you develop ideas of a project, these books are branches and the notebook where you write your final version of your work is the HEAD.\n",
    "### Creating new branches <a id='newbranches'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can use the ***git branch*** command to list, create, delete and manipulate branches. <br> Running ***git branch*** only shows all the branches created in the repository. <br> The command ***git branch new branch*** creates a new branch in the repository and with the command  ***git checkout new branch***  we can also switch to this branch, this steps we can make them in a single command ***git checkout -b new branch***.\n",
    "* Switching to another branch also changes the working tree and the commit history according to the last commit of the branch, if you wish delete a branch the command ***git checkout -d name-of-branch*** allows you to do that but if there are changes in the branch to delete that aren't in the HEAD, git will show a screen with a warning\n",
    "### Merging <a id='Merging'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Merging*** is the term that Git uses for combining branched data and history together<br> We use the command ***git merge-name-of-branch*** to combine the changes made in this branch with the HEAD, we will have problems if the changes made in these two branches diverge creating a ***merge conflict***\n",
    "* solving merge conflicts: if we have a merge conflict it is necessary to be solved, in that case we need to find where is located the conflict, for that reason is very useful to use ***git status*** to check the state of the repository and to find out hints, once found the conflict, we can edit the file to solve the problem after we need to add the files and commit them.  \n",
    "* if we can abort the merge we use *** git merge --abort***\n",
    "* the command ***git log --graph --oneline*** shows a graph about the commit history in the branches, it is very useful to understand merge conflicts.\n",

    "* One thing you must know is that in the remote repository can be created branches as well as the local repository allows, to access to one remote branch you need to pull it, merge it with the local branch then push back to its origin.\n",
    "* In the remote repository there is a master branch called origin which is update according to the master branch of the local repository.\n",
    "* These commands can be useful: ***git remote -v***,***git branch -r*** and the most important ***git remote show origin***, the last command give us the information about the local and remote repo.\n",
    "## Fetching new changes <a id='fetching'></a> \n",
    "\n",
    "* We have seen how pull updates to the local repository and push to the remote repository, now there is a command that allows do the same as pull, but it doesn't merge with our local repository, this command is ***git fetch***, with ***git fetch*** we can download all the changes made in the remote without merge in the local repo, the master in the remote repository is named as ***origin/master***, so knowing its name you can merge it with the local repository.\n",
    "* Also you can use ***git fetch*** to review the changes made in the remote repository\n",
    "\n",
    "## Updating the local repository <a id='updating'></a> \n",
    "\n",
    "* It is known the command ***git pull*** allows fetch and merge the contents of the local and remote repo, if there are more than one remote repo we can access to them only typing ***git checkout name-of-branch*** and we will working locally in the remote repo. \n",
    "* if we want the contents of the remote branches without merging we can use ***git remote update***\n",
